2. Fork the `develop` branch
3. Perform the pertinent change
4. Add the required unit/integration tests
5. Update the documentation accordingly in [this project](https://github.com/mongock/mongock-docs)
6. Raise a pull request for the documentation   
7. Raise a pull request for the actual change in the Mongock project, filling up the form you will find and providing the documentation pull request.

**Contributor raising successful pul request will get listed with special mention in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).**


### Implementing a new driver

Providing a new driver is considered the highest level of external contribution. On top of being in our [contributor page](https://www.mongock.io/v5/contribution/contributors), these kind of contributions are often **compensated with bounties**.

If you want to implement a driver not listed in our [suggested drivers](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/driver-requested), feel free to contact us [here](mailto:support@mongock.io) to make a suggestion.

To submit a new driver, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this [template repository](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/tree/develop/driver-template) in a independent folder.
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md inside the repo.
3. Once you are happy with your changes, raise a pull request as explained in the [pull requests section](#pull-requests)

**Contributor providing a new valid driver will be rewarded and listed with special mention in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)**

## Rewards :moneybag::moneybag:

We really value those open-source enthusiasts that want to contribute to the software community, and specially those that help Mongock to get better. That's why we have set
a rewarding plan to try to compensate the effort and obviously motivate them to be part of the Mongock's community.

- **Issue rewarding:** Submitting good issues  that represent real problems(or enhancements) is very important in an open-source project, and requires time and effort. This is why contributors that raise a valid issue will be recognised and listed in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

- **Discussion rewarding:** Similarly to issues, discussions are really helpful to improve the Mongock project. This area focuses less in fixing, but really helps us in getting new ideas or approaches. In the same way as issues, any contributor who starts(or participates in) a discussion will be recognised and listed in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

- **Code contribution rewarding:** In this case the contributor not only gets listed into our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md), also obtains a special mention. For requested features we often provide bounties to motivate our community. Visit our list [requested contributions](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/contribution-requested) and see if there is any with a bounty label, indicating the amount :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

- **Adding a new driver:** This is a special case within the `code contribution`. You can check our [suggested list of drivers](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/driver-requested), or suggest a different by contacting us [here](mailto:development@mongock.io)

### Bounty rewarding 

Steps to work on a bounty-rewarded contribution

1. Visit our list [requested contributions](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/contribution-requested)
2. Search for any issue with a bounty label (If you have thought in a feature that you believe it deserves a bounty, please contact the [mongock team](mailto:development@mongock.io)) If you are thinking in **providing a new driver, it's very likely we'll provide a bounty for it.**
3. Once you have decided in which issue you want to work on(and making sure it's ont already assigned to any other contributor), make a comment in the ticket itself claiming you will be working on it and make yourself an assignee
