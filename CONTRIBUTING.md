# Contributing to Mongock project

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

 The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Mongock project which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel
 free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Getting started

> :boom::rocket: Visit our page of [requested contribution](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/contribution-requested) to find out the best candidates and which of them are rewarded!!

Contributions are made to this repo via **issues**, **discussions** and **code contributions**.

## Rewards

We really value those open-source enthusiasts that want to contribute to the software community, and specially those that help Mongock to get better. That's why we have set
a rewarding plan to try to compensate the effort and contribution, and obviously motivate them to be part of the Mongock's community.

- **Issue rewarding**

Submitting an issue is really important in an open-source project and requires an effort from the issuer to submit a valid one, that really represents a problem(or enhancement), and the time to explaining corretly.

For this reason our contributors that raise a valid issue will be recognised and listed in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

- **Discussion rewarding**
Similarly to issues, discussions are really helpful to improve Mongock.This area focus less in fixing, but really helps us in getting new idea or approaches.
  
In the same way as issues, any contributor who starts(or participates in) a discussion will be recognised and listed in our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

- **Code contribution rewarding**

This is obviously the highest level of external contribution. In this case the contributor is not only listed into our [contributor list](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md), but gets also a special mention.

Apart from highlighting the effort of "getting the hands dirty", when there is a special requirement for a feature/fix, we provide bounties to motivate our community. Visit our list [requested contributions](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/contribution-requested) and see if there is any with a bounty label, indicating the amount :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Bounty rewarding

Steps to work on a bounty-rewarded contribution

1. Visit our list [requested contributions](https://github.com/mongock/mongock/labels/contribution-requested)
2. Search for any issue with a bounty label (If you have thought in a feature that you believe it deserves a bounty, please contact the [mongock team](mailto:development@mongock.io)) If you are thinking in **providing a new driver, it's very likely we'll provide a bounty for it.**
3. Once you have decided in which issue you want to work on(and making sure it's ont already assigned to any other contributor), make a comment in the ticket itself claiming you will be working on it and make yourself an assignee


> :rocket: If you are thinking in **providing a new driver that's not listed, it's very likely we'll provide a bounty for it anyway.**. Ask the [mongock team](mailto:development@mongock.io)
